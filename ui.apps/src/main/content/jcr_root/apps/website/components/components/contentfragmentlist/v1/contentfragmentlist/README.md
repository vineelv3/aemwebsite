Content Fragment List (v1)
====
Content Fragment List component written in HTL that renders a list of Content Fragments. Useful for authoring headless content that can be easily consumed by applications. 

## Features
* Displays a list of a Content Fragment assets based on a Content Fragment model
* The parent path for asset lookup is configurable
* The list can be filtered by tag
* The list can be ordered by an element or property - ascending or descending
* A subset of elements in the data model can be displayed

### Use Object
The Content Fragment List component uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.contentfragment.ContentFragmentList` Sling model as its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for the Content Fragment List component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./modelPath` - path to the Content Fragment Model on which the list is based.
2. `./parentPath` - parent path from which the list should be built.
3. `./tagNames` - tag names for filtering the list.
4. `./orderBy` - an element or property to order the list by.
5. `./sortOrder` - sort order ascending or descending.
6. `./maxItems` - defines the maximum number of items rendered by the list. If not defined, all fragments matching the query criteria are returned.
7. `./elementNames` - element names for limiting the model data displayed in the result.
8. `./id` - defines the component HTML ID attribute.

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.wcm.components.contentfragmentlist.v1.editor` editor client library category that includes JavaScript
handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.
