## Loading of CSS/JS
The page component automatically loads certain client libraries in the head section and at the end of the body section

Client Library Category or Path | Condition | Type | Head or Body
--- | --- | --- | ---
`cq.pagetypes.html5page`,`cq.authoring.page`,`cq.wcm.foundation-main`,`cq.shared` | only for `WCMMode`!=`Disabled` | JS and CSS | Head
libsScript from all referenced [cloud service configurations](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-3/develop/extending/cloud-service-configurations.html), by default `headlibs.jsp` | only in case there is a lib script found for the referenced cloud service config | anything | Head
`<clientlibsJsHead>` being set in component policy | only if `<clientlibsJsHead>` is set | JS | Head
`<clientlibs>` being set in component policy | only if `<clientlibs>` is set | CSS | Head
`<designpath>.css` | only if design is set for current page | CSS | Head
`<clientlibs>` being set in component policy | only if `<clientlibs>` is set. Categories duplicated in `<clientlibsJsHead>` are only loaded in the page head. | JS | Body

### Loading of Context-Aware CSS/JS
The page component also supports loading developer-defined context-aware CSS, Javascript or `meta` tags. This is done by creating a [context-aware resource](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/context-aware-configuration/context-aware-configuration.html#context-aware-resources) for `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.config.HtmlPageItemsConfig` with the following structure:

```
com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.config.HtmlPageItemsConfig
    - prefixPath="/some/path"
    + item01
        - element=["link"|"script"|"meta"]
        - location=["header"|"footer"]
        + attributes
            - attributeName01="attributeValue01"
            - attributeName02="attributeValue02"
            ...
    + item02
        ...
    ...
```
These items will be loaded in the header or footer of the page, depending on the configured `location`. The attribute names should match supported HTML attributes for [link](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp), [script](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp) and [meta](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp).

## Use Object
The Page component uses the following use objects:
* `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.Page`
* `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.SocialMediaHelper`
* `com.day.cq.wcm.foundation.TemplatedContainer`

## Component Policy Configuration Properties
The following configuration properties are used:

1. `./clientlibs` - allows definition of a list of client libraries to be loaded by the pages associated with this policy configuration
2. `./clientlibsJsHead` - allows definition of client libraries for which JavaScript is specifically intended to be loaded
in the document head (JavaScript only) of pages associated with this policy configuration
3. `./appResourcesClientlib` - allows definition of the client library that is used to serve web resources such as favicons
4. `./renderAlternateLanguageLinks` - toggles on/off the rendering of links to alternate language versions of the page in its head

## Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Page component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./jcr:title` - defines the page title, used for the page SEO meta title and on-page title (unless an overriding `./pageTitle` is defined).
2. `pageName` - defines the page name.
3. `./cq:tags` - defines the page SEO meta tags.
4. `./hideInNav` - if `true`, the page will be hidden in a navigation context (breadcrumb, navigation etc.).
5. `./pageTitle` - defines an alternative page title. Used for overriding the `./jcr:title` in an on-page context.
6. `./navTitle` - defines the page navigation title. Overrides other page titles, when the page is displayed in a navigation context (breadcrumb, navigation etc.).
7. `./subtitle` - defines the page subtitle.
8. `./jcr:description` - defines the page description.
9.  `./onTime` - defines when the page should become available.
10. `./offTime` - defines when the page should no longer be available.
11. `./sling:vanityPath` - defines a vanity URL at which the page could be accessed.
12. `./sling:redirect` - if `true`, the page will redirect to its defined vanity URL.
13. `./jcr:language` - defines the language set for this page, to help with `i18n`.
14. `./cq:designPath` - defines where the design for the page is stored.
15. `./sling:alias` - defines a Sling alias for the page, so that it can be accessed at a different resource path.
16. `./cq:allowedTemplates` - defines a template or a list of templates that the page should use.
17. `./cq:exportTemplate` - defines the template used for exporting the page for content synchronisation.
18. `./socialMedia` - defines the enabled social media configurations.
19. `./variantPath` - allows defining the social media variation experience fragment to be used for generating page metadata for social
media
20. `./cq:contextHubPath` - defines the Context Path configuration used by this page.
21. `./cq:contextHubSegmentsPath` - defines the Context Path Segments Path.
22. `./mainContentSelector` - defines the ID of the main content element of the page (used by the "skip to main content" accessibility feature).
23. `./id` - defines the component HTML ID attribute.

## Web Resources Client Library
A web resources client library can be defined at the template level (see `./appResourcesClientlib` component policy configuration).
This client library has to provide the following structure:

```json
{
  "<client library folder>": {
    "jcr:primaryType": "cq:ClientLibraryFolder",
    "allowProxy": true,
    "categories": [
      "<category name>"
    ],
    "css.txt": {"jcr:primaryType": "nt:file"},
    "resources": {
      "jcr:primaryType": "nt:folder"
      }
  }
}
```

The following files are expected in the `resources` folder, for maximum compatibility:

Filename|Browser|Size
--------|-------|----
apple-touch-icon-180x180.png|Safari on iPhone| 180px x 180px
apple-touch-icon-167x167.png|Safari on iPad Pro| 167px x 167px
apple-touch-icon-152x152.png|Safari on iPad, iPad Mini| 152px x 152px
apple-touch-icon-120x120.png|Safari on iPhone| 120px x 120px
icon-192x192.png|Chrome, Opera|192px x 192px
icon-310x310.png|Internet Explorer, Edge and Windows Phone|310px x 310px
icon-310x150.png|Internet Explorer, Edge and Windows Phone|310px x 150px
icon-150x150.png|Internet Explorer, Edge and Windows Phone|150px x 150px
icon-70x70.png|Internet Explorer, Edge and Windows Phone|70px x 70px

## Client Libraries
The component provides a `core.wcm.components.page.v2.sharing` client library category that contains the JavaScript
required to enable social sharing. It should be added to a relevant site client library using the `embed` property.

It also provides a `core.wcm.components.page.v2.editor` editor client library category that includes JavaScript
handling for dialog interaction. It is already included by its edit dialog.
