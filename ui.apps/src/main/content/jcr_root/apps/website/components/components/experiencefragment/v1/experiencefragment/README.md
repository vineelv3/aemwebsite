Experience Fragment (v1)
====
Experience fragment component written in HTL that renders an experience fragment variation.

## Features
* Can be used on both templates and pages.
* Defines a configurable experience fragment variation to be displayed.
* Supports references for localized content: if the component is defined in a template and if the fragment is part of a localized structure below `/content/experience-fragments` that follows the same patterns as the site below `/content`, the fragment with the same localization (language, blueprint or live copy) as the current page will be rendered.

### Use Object
The experience fragment component uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.ExperienceFragment` Sling model as its Use-object.

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following property is written to JCR for the experience fragment component and is expected to be available as a `Resource` property:

1. `./fragmentVariationPath` - defines the path to the experience fragment variation to be rendered.
2. `./id` - defines the component HTML ID attribute.

## BEM Description
```
BLOCK cmp-experiencefragment
  MOD cmp-experiencefragment--<name>
```

Note: the rendered HTML markup of the experience fragment component may contain CSS classes that start with `xf-` (e.g. `xf-content-height` or `xf-master-building-block`) -
those classes are private and should not be used in custom code (e.g. to style the markup).
